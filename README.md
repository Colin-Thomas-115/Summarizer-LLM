# Summarization-of-a-stack-of-papers-using-LLMs-
#### Authors: Ynes Ineza, Colin W. Thomas, Joseph Obasuyi, Tahmid Khan, Jaewook Kwon, and Israel Akpati
Summarizing a stack of papers involves systematically reviewing and condensing the key information from each paper to provide a concise overview. It is time consuming. To save readers’ time, it might be helpful to utilizing LLMs. Leveraging LLMs like GPT-3 for summarizing a stack of papers involves using natural language processing capabilities to generate concise and coherent summaries. It might be feasible to have two stages to come out the summarization of a stack of papers. The first step is to generate a summary for each paper using LLMs, and the second step is to aggregate all summaries of the stack of papers into a cohesive document.

  Kaggle, a Google subsidiary, is a virtual gathering place for data scientists and machine learning practitioners. It provides a platform where users can discover datasets for AI model development, share datasets, collaborate with other data enthusiasts, and participate in contests to address data science problems. Since its inception in 2010, Kaggle has been hosting machine learning and data science competitions, and it also provides a public data platform and cloud-based workspace for data science and AI learning.
