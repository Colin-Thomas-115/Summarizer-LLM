Summarizing a stack of papers involves systematically reviewing and condensing the key information from each paper to provide a concise overview. It is time consuming. To save readersâ€™ time, it might be helpful to utilizing LLMs. Leveraging LLMs like GPT-3 for summarizing a stack of papers involves using natural language processing capabilities to generate concise and coherent summaries. It might be feasible to have two stages to come out the summarization of a stack of papers. The first step is to generate a summary for each paper using LLMs, and the second step is to aggregate all summaries of the stack of papers into a cohesive document.
